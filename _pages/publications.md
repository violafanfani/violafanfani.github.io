# Projects

On GitHub you can see all the projects I am working on. Most of them are hosted on the 
 [lab's group](https://github.com/stracquadaniolab "Github").

<br />
The Bayesian Gene Heritability Analysis software ([BAGHERA](https://github.com/stracquadaniolab/baghera "BAGHERA")) estimates the contribution to the heritability of a trait/disease of all the SNPs in the genome (genome-wide heritability) and those nearby protein-coding genes (gene-level heritability).

Documentation can be found [here](https://baghera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "Baghera").

###  <img src="../images/pygna_logo.png" alt="drawing" width="150"/>
<br />
[PyGNA](https://github.com/stracquadaniolab/pygna "PyGNA") is a unified framework for network analysis of high-throughput experiment results. It can be used both as a standalone command line application or it can be included as a package in your own python code.

Pygna has now been published in BMC Bioinformatics! [https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-03801-1](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-03801-1)
