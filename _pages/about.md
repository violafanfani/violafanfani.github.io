<div style="text-align: justify"> 

I am a postdoc at the Harvard School of Public Health and I am a member of the Quackenbush Lab at the department of
Biostatistics.
I am working on  <mark>computational biology for cancer research</mark>. In particular I am developing models and
methods to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning cancer risk and development by focusing on the
regulatory changes that happen during cancer progression. I got my PhD
at the University of Edinburgh, with <a href="https://www.stracquadaniolab.org/">Dr. Giovanni Stracquadanio</a>. For my
thesis I used statistical
methods to decode hidden tumour mechanism and patterns by integrating high-throughput omic experiments and large
publicly available resources. Overall, I am trying to understand biology through fancy machine learning , but I also
know the power of linear regression!
