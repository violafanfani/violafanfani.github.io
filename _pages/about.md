Welcome on my web page and bear with me for its look! This website is still a work in progress, so far I am trying to keep it up to date.

I am a 3rd year PhD student at The University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of Dr. Giovanni Stracquadanio e Prof. Guido Sanguinetti. 
I am working on computational biology for cancer research. In particular I am developing models and methods to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning cancer risk and development. I am using statistical methods to decode hidden tumour mechanism and patterns by integrating high-throughput omic experiments and large publicly available resources. I am working on heritability, cancer networks, gene expression and pathway analysis. 

Bayesian statistics, machine learning, graph analysis, graph neural networks are some of the methods I have been using. 
Overall, I am trying to apply fancy machine learning to biology, but I also know the power of linear regression!


News
======

 * I am excited to be participating into the ucoming "The Biology of Genomes" Virtual Meeting, 5 - 8 May. I'll also be presenting my poster: 
 _Decoding cancer risk in the broader population with gene-level heritability_.

 * I am taking part into the Reading Club about graph neural networks organised by [Dr. Dimitri Ognibene.](https://sites.google.com/site/dimitriognibenehomepage/graph-net-reading-group "do"). Check it out and join us for a chat!
