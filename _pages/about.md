<div style="text-align: justify"> 

I am a 3rd year PhD student at The University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.stracquadaniolab.org/">Dr. Giovanni Stracquadanio</a> and Prof. Guido Sanguinetti. I am working on  <mark>computational biology for cancer research</mark>. In particular I am developing models and methods to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning cancer risk and development. I use statistical methods to decode hidden tumour mechanism and patterns by integrating high-throughput omic experiments and large publicly available resources. Overall, I am trying to understand biology through fancy machine learning , but I also know the power of linear regression!

 * I am excited to be participating into the upcoming __"The Biology of Genomes"__ Virtual Meeting, 5 - 8 May. I'll also be presenting my poster: 
 _Decoding cancer risk in the broader population with gene-level heritability_.

 * I am taking part into the __Reading Club about graph neural networks__ organised by [Dr. Dimitri Ognibene](https://sites.google.com/site/dimitriognibenehomepage/graph-net-reading-group "do"). Check it out and join us for a chat!
